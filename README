The issue I am solving in this project is a binary classification problem. Using training data images of two types, 
aerial shots including rivers and aerial shots not including rivers, I trained a classifier to distinguish between “river” and 
“non-river” input test images. HOG Feature extraction was used in combination with an SVM classifier. The different parameters that 
can be tuned to alter the efficiency of the predictions were examined. The code for the project as well as the data and report are included
in the repository.
